+ "Often, an Improvised Weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such.For example, a table leg is akin to a club.At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her Proficiency Bonus."
+ "An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee Attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage.An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.";
